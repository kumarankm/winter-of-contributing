# Python: OOP-Inheritance #567

## Introduction :

Inheritance is one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The ability of one class to inherit another class is called Inheritance. By doing this, we can get a hierarchy of classes.


## Related terms :

<b>superclass</b> : The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or the superclass. 

<b>subclass</b> : The class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass or a child class.


## Advantages :

There are many advantages of inheritance, these are -
1. Inheritance makes the code reusable. To put in simple words, a class created through inheritance can inherit the attributes and the methods of its parent class. 
2. Inheritance makes the code short and concise making it more reliable and readable. 
3. It also makes the code easy to debug.


## Example :

Let's say we have created a class named <b>'Marks'</b>. There are two methods in this class. 
1. One is to take inputs of the marks of various subjects and 
2. the other is to display the marks. 

Now, a child class named <b>'Results'</b> ia created by inheriting from the parent class that is <b>'Marks'</b>. Results have teo methods 
1. a constructor and 
2. a displayResult() method.

Now the constructor of the base class is called using its class name along with the dot operator and also total marks and percentage are calculated inside the constructor of the derived class. Then in the <b>displayResult( )</b> method, the total marks and percentage are displayed.
