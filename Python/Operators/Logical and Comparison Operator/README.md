# What are Operators?

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Or
Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

# What are Operands?
The values the operator works on are called operands.

Consider the expression 3 + 5 = 8. Here, 3 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.

## Why Operators are used

Operators are the basic concept of any programming language, used to build a foundation in programming for freshers. 
An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.

# Types of Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Membership Operators
- Identity Operators
Just like in mathematics, programming languages like Python have operators. You can think of them as extremely simple functions that lie at the basis of computer science. These are the simplest operations to which a computer program can be reduced. They are essential knowledge for any aspiring Data Scientist or Software Engineer.

## Let's discuss about Logical Operator and Comparison Operator :

## Logical Operators

Python logical operators allow us to perform logical AND, OR, and NOT operations between boolean values.
Examples:
- and(Logical AND)    If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.           
- or(Logical OR)      True if either of the operands is true
- not(Logical NOT)    Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.

#### Syntax :
- x and y
- x or y
- not x

## Comparison Operators

Comparison or relation operations are used to compare two values and determine the relation between then.
Examples: == , != , > , <  etc.
-  ==      Equal
-  !=      Not Equal
-  >       Greater than
-  <       Less than
-  >=      Greater than or equal to
-  <=      Less than or equal to

#### Syntax :
- x==y
- x!=y
- x>y
- x<y
- x>=y
- x<=y
