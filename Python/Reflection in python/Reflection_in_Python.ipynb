        "Reflection in Python refers to the code in which it is used to check the attributes of an object passed as a parameter to a function. That means, type(obj) method is passed obj as a parameter, it will return the type of the class of that obj.\n",
        "With the use of reflection we can create reverse recursive function work for strings, lists, and any other sequence that supports slicing and concatenation.If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str type object. Further, if we write str() we get a string which is the empty string. In other words, writing str() is the same thing as writing “”. Likewise, writing list() is the same thing as writing [].\n",
