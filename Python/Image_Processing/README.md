# #6500 [Python] : Image Processing using Python

- Image Processing is the method through which, some meaningful operations can be performed on the Image using tools or languages.

- We use Python here for the Image processing part.

- Unlike traditional photo editing software, where we use the GUI to do editing, here Python has the Pillow library to do Image processing tasks

- The Pillow library can be installed by using the pip package manager.

- The latest version of the Pillow Library is 8.4.0, which is a fork of the PIL library (which is abbreviated as Python Image Processing Library).

- This library offers numerous actions such as , enhanching a image,Postscript printing, reading binary data, creating JPEG thumbnails,convert file formats .etc

- There is also one interesting class from this library , i.e. __PixelAccess__ class. This class will actually access each pixel from the Image and change its parameters

- In this Jupyter notebook, I have explored the basic parts of Image processing using Python such as cropping, rotating..

- Further documentation of the Pillow library can be accessed at : "https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"

- You can also contribute to Pillow at "https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow"
