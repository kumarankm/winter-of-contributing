# What is Flask?
Flask is an micro framework offering basic features of web app. This framework has no dependencies on external libraries. The framework offers extensions for form validation, object-relational mappers, open authentication systems, uploading mechanism, and several other tools. Flask may be a generally youthful framework, as it were in utilize since 2010. Flask is considered more “Pythonic” than Django is basically since Flask web application code is, in most cases, more unequivocal.
# What is Django?
Django is a web development framework for Python. This framework offers a standard method for fast and effective website development. It helps you in building and maintaining quality web applications. It enables you to make the development process smooth and timesaving. It is a high-level web framework which allows performing rapid development. The primary goal of this web framework is to create complex database-driven websites. Django is commonly called a “batteries-included” system approach—or the “framework for fussbudgets with deadlines.” This implies that Django makes it simple for Python designers to jump into web applications rapidly without requiring planning into the app’s framework ahead of time.

# Django vs Flask
Django and Flask are two of the most popular web frameworks for Python. Flask showed up as an alternative to Django, as designers needed to have more flexibility that would permit them to decide how they want to implement things, while on the other hand, Django does not permit alteration of their modules to such degree. Flask is truly so straightforward and direct that working in it permits an experienced Python designer making ventures inside truly tight timeframes. Here are a few Flask and Django use cases: Flask is extraordinary for building basic locales with inactive substance, like blogs; it gives all the usefulness you would like and permits for customization to a tremendous degree whereas Django is incredible for building complex destinations with energetic substance, with adaptability in intellect; enormous ventures that require out-of-the-box arrangements can be sent truly quick.

# Admin Interface
Not at all like Flask, Django incorporates a ready-to-use admin system that empowers clients to carry out the extend organization errands consistently. The useful admin interface is what makes Django a capable web system. Based on the venture, it naturally creates admin modules. Engineers can customize the admin interface to meet the trade needs.

# Database
Django has bolstered for the ORM framework. 
Advantage of ORM framework includes: 
-	Developers can take advantage of the ORM framework to work with an assortment of databases, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Prophet, MySQL and more. 
-	Developers don’t have to type in long SQL inquiries to execute common database operations. Whereas   Flask doesn’t support the ORM framework. 
-	Designers are required to type in SQLAlchemy (Protest Social Mapper and SQL toolkit for Python) in arrange to perform common database operations.


# Built-in template engine
Not at all like Django, Flask doesn’t have a built-in layout motor. Flask is based on the Jinja2 format motor. Jinja2 is itself impacted by the Django format motor. Its employments coordinate a sandboxed execution environment, permitting engineers to speed up the advancement handle for energetic web applications. While Django incorporates a built-in format motor that permits engineers to make user-facing layers for web applications consistently and quickly. 

# KEY DIFFERENCES:
-	Flask provides support for API while Django doesn’t have any support for API.
-	Flask does not support dynamic HTML pages and Django offers dynamic HTML pages.
-	Flask is a Python web framework built for rapid development whereas Django is built for easy and simple projects.
-	Flask offers a diversified working style while Django offers a Monolithic working style.
-	URL dispatcher of the Flask web framework is a RESTful request on the other hand, URL dispatcher of Django framework is based on controller-regex.
-	Flask is WSGI framework while Django is a Full Stack Web Framework.

# Advantages of Django
Here, are pros/benefits of Django framework:
-	Django is easy to set up and run
-	It provides an easy-to-use interface for various administrative activities.
-	It offers multilingual websites by using its built-in internationalization system
-	Django allows end-to-end application testing
-	Allows you to document your API with an HTML output

-	It is used for rate-limiting API requests from a single user.
-	Helps you to define patterns for the URLs in your application
-	Offers built-in authentication system
-	Cache framework comes with multiple cache mechanisms.
-	High-level framework for rapid web development
-	A complete stack of tools
-	Data modelled with Python classes
# Disadvantage of Flask
Here, are cons/drawback of Flask
-	Slower MVP development in most cases,
-	Higher maintenance costs for more complex systems
-	Complicated maintenance for larger implementations.
-	Async may be a little problem
-	Lack of database and ORM
-	Setting up a large project requires some previous knowledge of the framework
-	Offers limited support and smaller community compared to Django
# Disadvantage of Django
Here, are cons/drawback of the Django framework
-	It is a monolithic platform.
-	High dependence on Django ORM. Broad Knowledge required.
-	Fewer Design decisions and Components.
-	Compatibility with the latest technologies
-	A higher entry point for simple solutions
-	The larger size of the code
-	Too bloated for small projects
-	Underpowered templating and ORM
-	Templates failed silently
-	Auto reload restarts the entire server
-	High learning curve
-	Documentations does not cover real-world scenarios
-	Only allows you to handle a single request per time.
-	Routing requires some knowledge of regular expressions
-	Internal subcomponents coupling
-	You can deploy components together, which can create confusion.
# Which is Better?
-	You should prefer flask if you want the granular level of control while a Django developer relies on an extensive community to create unique website.
-	Django combined with the REST Framework helps you to build powerful APIs, whereas Flask requires more work, so there are high chances to make a mistake.
-	The best method is to build a few basic CRUD apps with both frameworks and decide which framework fits your project style better.                            |
